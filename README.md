This project finds the average temperature of a university by using several APIs. First, it sorts through universities and chooses all universities that match a search or keyword. Then using the results of that API, it finds the geographical location of each univerisity using a different API. After that, the program uses coordinates to find a past hourly temperature list at that location. Lastly, using the list of temperatures, it calculates the average temperature for each location.
